./GameEngine

Base folder for the project
Includes configure scripts and
Makefile for compilation

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/cores

Contains core files for the game engine
Including main.c for engine entry point
Most of files would be *.c files or *.cpp

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/includes

Contains used libraries for the game engine
Including SDL and Javascript engine
Most of files would be *.c or *.cpp

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/modules

Contains GameEngine elements, which are not
core parts of the engine, but features that people may want to add
like better physics or AI modules.
These are compiled runtime elements
You can link or unlink these "modules" from game engine
We seperated this part from cores for better exensibility
Most of files would be *.c or *.cpp

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/scripts

Contains Game elements(rather than GameEngine).
These scripts will be interpreted by Javascript engine
and control Game behaviors
If some part of your game is not computationally heavy
and has complex behavior, rather than implementing it to *.c file,
consider using scripts.
Most of files would be *.js

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/assets

Contains assets for the game
like sounds, sprites and animations
assets folder can further subdivided into assets/sounds, assets/arts...
Most of files would be sound files, pictures or *.js files.

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/etc

We may have some files not fitting into any of other folders
We'll keep those in here

[------------------------------------------------------------------------------]

./GameEngine/docs

Contains documentations about GameEngine.
Most of files would be *.txt files.
